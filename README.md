# Ordinal-Regression-Brain-Region
This code creates a knitr report for analyzing 48 brain regions via ordinal regression to detect genotype differences over time.

Code should be fairly well documented.

Each region was analyzed using ordinal regression with a cumulative logistic model. For each region an interaction between genotype and months was initially investigated via a likelihood ratio test (LRT); this interaction was dropped for models with p > 0.15 based on the LRT. Likelihood ratio tests were again performed to determine if there existed signifcant genotype difference either across all timepoints or if genotype differences changed over time.  P-values from these LRTs were false discovery rate adjusted via Benjamini-Hochberg to account for multiple testing of 48 regions. Post-hoc tests were then performed via emmeans with, again, an FDR adjustment for multiple testing. Second generation p-values following the guidance of Blume et al (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2018.1537893) with a null interval: odds ratio within 0.9 - 1.1, were also calculated. In general second generation p-values control the family wise error rate as well as FDR, but can often identify additional differences when the number of comparisons is greater than 10.  The null interval of 0.9 - 1.1 (i.e. within 10% difference), was chosen to be a somewhat conservative range; Blume et al used 0.95 - 1.05 for reference.
