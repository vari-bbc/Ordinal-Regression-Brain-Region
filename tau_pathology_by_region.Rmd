# Methods

Each region was analyzed using ordinal regression with a cumulative logistic model. For each region an interaction between genotype and months was initially investigated via a likelihood ratio test (LRT); this interaction was dropped for models with p > 0.15 based on the LRT. Likelihood ratio tests were again performed to determine if there existed signifcant genotype difference either across all timepoints or if genotype differences changed over time.  P-values from these LRTs were false discovery rate adjusted via Benjamini-Hochberg to account for multiple testing of 48 regions. Post-hoc tests were then performed via emmeans with, again, an FDR adjustment for multiple testing. Second generation p-values following the guidance of Blume et al (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2018.1537893) with a null interval: odds ratio within 0.9 - 1.1, were also calculated. In general second generation p-values control the family wise error rate as well as FDR, but can often identify additional differences when the number of comparisons is greater than 10.  The null interval of 0.9 - 1.1 (i.e. within 10% difference), was chosen to be a somewhat conservative range; Blume et al used 0.95 - 1.05 for reference.

#This line outputs a table of genotype counts by timepoint
knitr::kable(table(data$Genotype,data$Months))

# This is the analysis function which we will run for each individual region. It first fits the ordinal regression assuming an interaction between time and Genotype, and runs a test to determine if the genotype differences vary by timepoint (i.e. if there is evidence of this interaction existing). If there is no evidence of an interaction (here we use a conservative p = 0.15 to determine this), the interaction is dropped and the genotype difference is assumed to be consistent across each timepoint. If p < 0.15, the interaction is kept and we test to see at which timepoints the differences occur. I intially attempted to run months as a categroical variables, but this caused convergence issues when modelling; because of this we will have to model months as a continuous variable. This is a stricter assumption than I would normally make as it assumes the relatinship between the log(odds) and months is linear, but it appears that this produced a fine enough fit.

analysis = function(region){
  #We fit two models here, one with the interaction and one without.  This will allow us to use a likelihood ratio test for both the genotype:months interaction, and genotype differences across all timepoints. We use LRT because with these sample sizes, it will be noticeably more powerful.

    #for these regions where the interaction wasn't significant, we want to test for a genotype effect, so we fit a third model with only months in it so we can agian use a LRT

# Analysis
## Genotype * Month Interaction
In the table below we have p-values for either 'genotype' or 'genotype:months'.  A significant 'genotype x month' p-value indicates that the genotype difference depends on time (that is, a difference may exist only at specific times). A signifcant 'genotype' p-value indicates a consistent genotype difference across all timepoints.  Here we see evidence that cCA1 and cENTl have a consistent genotype difference across all timepoints and that there is also evidence of a genotype difference in cPRE, but that it depends on time.

## Results By Timepoint {.tabset}

For each of these results sections, the 'Estimate' can be used to determine which genotype had more tau pathology where a postive number indicates G20 had more pathology and a negative would suggest NTG has more pathology.

### Regions with FDR < 0.1 

Based on the FDR adjusted p-values we were only able to detect the genotype difference for cCA1 and cENTl, the p-values for the cPRE difference was not significant by FDR. This is likely due to the fact that FDR is still a bit conservative and the differences by timepoint have not yet gotten large enough to confidently say they differ based on FDR p-values (i.e. it may take 12+ months for the genotype differences to diverge enough to detect them with this sample size and FDR corrections).  
 
```{r}

knitr::kable(time.res[time.res$`FDR` < 0.1,],digits=3)

```

### Regions with 2nd generation p-value = 0

With the second generation p-value we again see the genoptye difference in the cENTl and cCA1 regions, but we were also able to pick up iAOB at 9 months, iSUB at 1 and 3 months, iMRN at all timepoints, and cPRE at 1 and 9 months.  Note that each of these also has a signficant unadjusted p-value, again I think the FDR is being a touch too conservative. An interesting note on cPRE, at 1 month NTG has an estimated higher pathology, but at 9 months G20 has more; this is a good example of why including the interaction is important, as the differences here change in both sign and magnitude over time.

```{r}

knitr::kable(time.res[time.res$`Second gen` == 0,],digits=3)

```


### Regions with unadjusted p < 0.05
With the unadjusted p-values we again see the genoptye difference in the cENTl and cCA1 regions, iAOB at 9 months, iSUB at 1 and 3 months, iMRN at all timepoints, and cPRE at 1 and 9 months. With only 1 addition of iAOB at 6 months.

```{r}
knitr::kable(time.res[time.res$`Unadjusted p` < 0.05,],digits=3)
```

### All regions

A note on these results.  A second generation p-value of zero is signifcant, a second gen p-value of 1 indicates signficant evidence of the NULL being true (i.e. detect evidence of no difference, something that can't be done with conventional p-values), and 0.5 would mean there is currently equal evidence for a difference and no difference. We see many 0.5s here because the range of the confidence intervals is still quite large (due mainly to the sample size), so there could be more region differences, but we were under powered to detect them. As of right now the remaining differences are inconclusive.
